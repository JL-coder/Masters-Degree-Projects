CC the department heads and deans at the university(s) where the authors of this paper work. This is academic fraud and it is generally taken very seriously.

EDIT: as others mentioned below, looks like it's a pre-print.  All authors use a gmail address, except the lead. The upload occured from one of the authors with a gmail address.  Searching on LinkedIn the lead is a university instructor. Makes me wonder if this was student project she advised and was unaware of the plagiarism.   In that case, I suppose I might start by reaching out to the lead author on  LinkedIn or via email and see how far that gets you. Next step would be to reach out to the university (dept head and dean).","Holy shit they aren't even trying to hide it. Looks like the ""research paper"" is just a preprint, and it definitely won't be getting published in any reputable journal.

I don't think there's much you can do since they're not in the U.S. and this hasn't been published. You can report their work to ResearchGate to try to get it taken down ([https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy](https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy)). You could also try contacting the university or one of the researchers. There's a chance this is one of the researcher's thesis/project and the other ""collaborators"" are just supervisors that don't know it's plagiarized. However, as another commenter said, other countries have higher tolerance for plagiarism.","Yeah, this is bizarre. It's not a published journal paper, it's just a preprint so there is no editor to connect with.

But yes, there is a huge difference between somebody who has perfect aim with a hammer and a true craftsman.",[deleted],"It is also important to understand what that ""science"" thing means.  It means is applying the scientific method to improve understanding.

The steps to the Scientific Method are:

1) Pose a Testable Question.  
2) Conduct Background Research.  
3) State your Hypothesis.  
4) Design Experiment.  
5) Perform your Experiment.  
6) Collect Data.  
7) Draw Conclusions.  
8) Publish Findings (optional).

You also are NOT trying to prove the hypothesis.  Let the facts speak for themselves and getting a clear example that invalidates a hypothesis is a powerful way to improve understanding."

Thank you!,Jumping in to say that your sheet just might have got me my current job - was excellent to have to hand for Zoom interviews. Legend.,"This is an excellent resource for reviewing ML concepts, but I don't think calling it a DS cheatsheet is helping. There's already enough people thinking DS = ML.

A true DS cheatsheat would have sections on how to solve actual business problems, common KPIs, how to build and evaluate data/ML pipelines, etc. I know you said the purpose was to tackle things that are common to all DS positions, but IMO the things that are common (ML algorithms) generally make up a very small portion of any one job.

11,2021-02-15,933,Please STOP asking Data Scientists about Leetcode questions meant for Software Engineers for job interviews,"I‚Äôm a software engineer who worked on a data science team for a while, and I have to say, the sheer amount of stuff someone with the title data scientist is expected to know is a bit overwhelming.","I‚Äôm not surprised most companies get little to no value from their data science efforts. I would argue casual inference and experimental design is more important and useful than predictive modelling in many cases, but nobody really cares or asks. Domain knowledge is also key so you know you‚Äôre solving the right problem. It‚Äôs a damn shame, as the view of data science has become very myopic these days.","To be fair, Leetcode style questions have little to do with most of what SWEs do as well but they still interview each other using that format. 

It's a broken system for sure but it's also not that hard to learn enough just to pass technical interviews."

Have come far from that. 

But imposter syndrome is always there.","In my last project, I was actually the ‚Äúleast skilled‚Äù member on my team. I say this as objectively as possible, even though I have been riddled by imposter syndrome from time to time. The team and I were able to successfully build a trained agent to play a game through some very complicated data infrastructure. From this project, I learned quite a bit include Docker containerization, Git branching, Azure and Object oriented programming.

In my current project, I am able to use the skills I learned to create value for my team where we‚Äôre building an end to end data pipeline for geospatial analytics. I came woefully prepared for it due to my past experiences, and was able to offer immediate value for the project. My project manager was already surprised that I completed half of my assigned tickets in one day. 

So even if you are actually the weakest link in the team, don‚Äôt let that discourage you from growing professionally. You‚Äôre capable of doing the work and there is a reason why you initially joined the team.

13,2021-05-28,907,First two weeks of my first internship,"Congratulations!! Keep us updated on your professional growth!

RemindMe! 3 years","I feel you man.

I came to Europe from a country in the middle east, where we dont even have electricity 24/7...

I had no work experience after graduating from my Bachelor in Civil Engineering and minimal coding experience in Python.

I started learning Python from scratch on my own on my first few days in Europe, then received a DataCamp account. Started my course on Data science. Then I secured a first summer internship at a big 4 without a salary. I said to myself it is fine, I gain experience now, maybe later I can find a job. Then I got a second internship on december 2020 at a second big4 until april 2021.

Then to my luck, I got recruited by a company as a Data Analyst and got my first official salary a few days ago.

It sounds stupid to many, because they are fortunate to live in good countries. But for some of us it is a true accomplishment. **So be happy**! 

And for sure stay with them!!","Congratulations on that. I am literally in the exact same boat... I didn't grow up in a rich family and for the first 10 years of my working life, I made less than 25k working dead end jobs.

18,2021-02-23,773,My first technical interview experience(22+ interview questions),"I would bomb this, my spot recollection of specific technical information is pretty poor, especially if I were getting machine gun quizzed. I have 3+ years of DS experience and at my company have reasonable business impact. 

I'm also shocked you were able to remember or otherwise write down these all questions during a 45min interview.","I think for #2 he just wanted you to explicitly say we do some sort of feature selection or dimensionality reduction to deal with the curse of dimensionality, especially after saying he wanted to do a linear regression.","Great post.  I can tell you, as someone who has been a ""Data Scientist""  since 2011  and a few years of remote sensing scientist before that, that you did significantly better than I would have.

Do most people run into interviews like this?  My experience hasn't been this way.  I've had to code and solve problems but they're rarely 
questions like this.  These are the kind of thing I'd look up when trying to solve a specific problem but wouldn't know offhand.   Usually the questions have been more in line with being given a data set or SQL table and having to solve various things, write functions to accomplish a task, or solving expected values of some various problems.  Admittedly, I havent interviewed seriously in 5 years, but I know there is no way I'd pass this without some serious brushing up.

Nice job, seems like you did well!"
19,2021-02-06,755,Is anybody else here trying to actively push back against the data science hype?,"If you don't already have a team of data engineers and business analysts, you don't need a neural network. It's like when a child demands a ""dinosaur rocket ship machine gun superhero fire engine"" for their birthday.","I had an interview for a DS position the other day.  I was prepared to talk about my experiences with ML, NN, and past projects. Instead it was an hour long technical discussion on basic SQL. What is a case statement?  What are the different types of joins?  How do you do filter a table ( WHERE )?

This was for a senior position leading a team of 7 Juniors.","This is true in all technology (obviously a generalization), not just DS. Smaller companies tend to be especially crazy with their pie in the sky thinking.

Anything that gets industry/media buzz but has underlying technology the lay business person doesn't/won't understand is vulnerable to this.

Companies will then want their own ""cloud-based api connected predictive analytic engine"" (for $500) because they've seen those buzzwords a lot in the last 6 months and want to keep up with Jones."
20,2021-04-02,744,"Against the negativity here, I just received my $200k salary offer in just 2 years (even in this economy)",The negativity is mostly around entry-level jobs (i.e. 0-1 YoE). I don't think (on average) applicants with 2+ YoE are finding the job search process nearly as harsh.,"Yeah, FAppleNG DS roles pay 200k base at staff level, but even at senior you get 200k cash. Plus total comp reaches 200k+ at just regular L4 (i.e. one promo after newgrad level). And that's not even for ML-heavy or pseudo-SWE DS roles.

Yes yes SWEs usually earn more, but if you don't enjoy the role and aren't good at it, why try for that when there are plenty of well-paying DS roles out there.","I got a job offer back in late July for $230K, so no there is no problem in the market if you have the experience. I don't understand how many times this needs to be said for everyone to fully comprehend it, the data science market is over-saturated in the entry-level positions, because there is a lot of hype over how much this jobs pays, so a lot of people went to school for a DS master, a lot of people went for a boot camp, a lot of people who are doing a Ph.D. dropped their program, peopled who already finished a STEM Ph.D. and have the qualification, to people who watched a video on self-driving cars, all those people want data science jobs.

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ",I'm not convinced my profile got reviewed.
25,2021-01-14,684,"We Need More Data Engineers, Not Data Scientists","There is a rather clear shift in the market indeed which can be explained by different factors:

* Data leaders are more educated and now know better what it takes to run a successful data team as they generally have witnessed it or done it in a couple of companies before.
* Those companies realize that the basis of a good DS work is to have the data neatly acquired, processed, modelled, organized and accessible. Doing this right makes the reporting, science and all other downstream parts much easier.
* They also realize that this is a specific skillset and it should not fall on the shoulder of a data scientist but of a dedicated data engineer.
* In parallel, the Data Scientist role starts to be divided into more precise sub roles, some more oriented towards business (business analyst, product analyst, data analyst, BI developer,...) some more towards engineering (ML Engineer, ML Ops, ML Scientist,...). So there are less purely ""Data Scientist"" roles but a bunch of new specialized roles which bring more clarity towards what's actually expected from the professionals.
* Another trend is the greater need for automation and therefore engineering. During years companies/DSs have developed methods to solve some specific problems and some of these tools are becoming standard and can be mostly/fully automated. Therefore, there is a need for more engineering-focused role to do this correctly.

EDIT: Forgot to add: volume of data is also getting bigger with time, so that also generates a higher need for people who actually know how to deal with such volumes.","We also need data scientists that focus on stats ... or .. and this is going to be mind boggling ... we need actual statisticians .

I think the ideal data science team should pair highly experienced and trained statisticians with their counterpart CS/data engineer to solve a DS problem.",Software engineer here that has been doing data engineering for the past years. For some reason software engineering seems to still pay more than data engineering roles. Also not having to deal with matching table records or semi-manual etl jobs is another plus. I wonder if data engineer salaries will raise in the next years.
26,2021-07-19,675,"FYI: If You're New to the Industry, the Data Science Job Market is Saturated","In my opinion, it is much safer to develop expertise in a domain (healthcare, insurance, banking etc.) and then apply data science principles to your domain. That's what I have done. I am not a data scientist and nobody will hire me for my data science ""skills"" (honestly I am not skilled like many people in this sub). Instead I have been able to cement my reputation (and get good raises) as I brought data driven insights and speed to decision making in my job. This may not be possible for everyone but developing domain expertise and then applying data science is easier that chasing a few pure play data science positions.",And many of them aren‚Äôt worth hiring.,"The industry is the wild west. Everyone sees the common themes: no one knows what data scientist means, misaligned expectations, non existent workflows and pipelines, companies having no strategy when hiring a data scientist, frankly inability to identify strengths, etc, etc. It's going to be like this for a while. Best way in as I see it, get some sme knowledge and learn the data science pieces. Take focused course work with this edge. Building models is foundational, and yet probably less than 10% of the battle."

The original icon was testing, but had complaints it was hard to see, which was understandable and it turned out to be not in free domain. So I had to make a quick change and I figured floppy disk was storage related and nostalgic for some.

28,2021-03-17,657,Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,"Great post!

I would add that, particularly on LinkedIn, there is an ""instagram"" effect where people are broadcasting their achievements but people rarely call out the challenges or where they fail.","This resonates strongly with me. Thank you for sharing your experiences in such a well-thought-out post!  Something I struggle with in data science is there are SO MANY THINGS to learn and it‚Äôs very difficult to decide what to prioritize.  I end up working myself to death. 

For instance, I‚Äôm looking for a new job. What I want is to work on a small team of people with diverse educational backgrounds, struggle through problems, and make good things happen. I know I can teach myself anything. That‚Äôs basically what all my years of school were for; not an end goal of ‚Äúknowledge,‚Äù but rather a framework for being able to learn and do anything in DS.  But others don‚Äôt think this way (see: all job descriptions in DS).  What if the perfect job passes me by because something they need isn‚Äôt on my resume?  What if it passes me by because I don‚Äôt have a PhD?  Both have happened. It only increases my feeling of incompetence. 

So, my problem is I don‚Äôt KNOW what to prioritize because a) there is just so much to learn and frankly almost all of it is interesting, and b) my career goals are oriented more around working on hard problems and solving them, and less on what the specific problems are.",Also- ask your boss. My company is big on angular so I planned to learn it in my free time. But boss lady said she really needed an API product owner for an api we are taking over from from another Dept... so now I am getting better with API‚Äôs and focusing on that

32,2021-02-27,648,R is far superior to Python for data manipulation.,"As someone who spends a lot of time using both R and Python about 50/50, here's how it plays out in reality:

- R is better for: tabular data manipulation, data viz, simple models (e.g. OLS).

- Python is better for: *Everything else*, including nontabular data manipulation, neural networks/AI, and most importantly deployment.

*You can do all tasks in both languages*, but usually it comes at the cost of unexpected technical debt if you don't use the right tool for the right job.","Without arguing with your points I just want to say that in pandas you can also chain operations to create variables, manipulate them, and so on. For example:

    (df.assign(c = df['a'] + 2)

     .dropna())

It surprises me, that people often forget about it.

As for me, I tried using R without Tidyverse of dplyr and didn't like it.

Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people have done that project too. Instead, use what you learned in the MOOC and do your own project with your own data."

Some people enjoy personal projects, and it's not really ""work"" to them, and others don't.  The vast majority of people fall into the latter group, you just don't hear about them since why would they post to technical forums about not doing a project?

Not doing personal projects doesn't preclude learning though.  I've found I don't stick with personal projects long-term, and that's fine.  However, I find it really easy to crack open a book and read about technical things for 30-60 minutes randomly, and I learn a lot this way.  Maybe you'd enjoy that.  If not, try watching youtube videos about new topics, or reading blog posts.  Maybe you don't like any of it, and that's fine too.  A job can be a job - it doesn't need to invade your personal time and you don't need to apologize to anyone if this is the case.","Can I just say as a neuroscientist this is not your fault. Basically we think we have control over what we do but this is an illusion. For example you want to work on your project but you never do. So then you feel shame/guilt etc which only makes you more unproductive.

The solution to this is that the mind behaves more like a computer than we think. If you know how to properly interact with it you can make it do whatever you want. Now there is a long list of behavioural psychology focused on productivity but I will start you of with one thing.

Right now create a list it can be on your computer a website like [trello.com](https://trello.com) or on paper it doesn't matter. On it write 6 Things that you can accomplish very quickly in relation to your project.

for example the list could be this.

1. make a project directory for my project.
2. download the dataset needed
3. install required tools for project
4. write first variable
5. write first function
6. Make the first graph

Set the commitment to do just one of these things per day, you don't have to do anymore.

Try adding new goals to your list as you complete old ones.

the goals should be easy to achieve 1 minute - 30 minutes for each.

Pretty soon you will be doing more than just one task.

This method efficiently uses your brains reward system. Doing small clearly defined tasks with low commitment is easy and generally fun to do.

Doing a large complicated project with no clear approach is not fun to do.

There are tonnes of efficiency hacks and every person is different. Good luck.","I struggle with this.

I'm guessing two (interrelated) things here: roles are more sophisticated and companies know better what they want/need. The same way we no longer have web masters/designers as we did in 1995, now we may not have a data scientist but rather some people analysing data, some designing models and some others deploying them. Then, I don't think that many companies need cutting-edge DS. Many people here have commented doing relatively straightforward tasks, and I guess that your average Acme co doesn't need much more than that, so why hire a scientist when an analyst will do (then again, many companies could benefit from using more sophisticated techniques but we know many settle for the good enough and I couldn't really blame them).

A good interview process shouldn't only be them evaluating you. You also have to decide if you'll work there. So ask lots of questions about their org chart, their processes, their culture. Ask them what their current biggest challenges are. Ask how evaluations are conducted, how do people know what the overall business goals are. Ask the person who is interviewing you what specifically keeps them working there. Ask what the onboarding process is like. Ask how often projects are delivered on time. Better, ask if the project this person is currently workin on is on time. And if not, why. (It's ok if it's not, that happens. But the why matters). Ask about their ETL architecture, their data quality processes, and their documentation.

50,2021-02-03,481,Networking - it's not just LinkedIn connections,"One thing I want to add is that you should be nice to internal recruiters and importantly, keep their contact info/Linkedin handy.  Everytime you go through the interview process for a job and you think you've built a good relationship with the recruiter, make that person a new connection.  Even if you don't get the offer then, or pull out for other reasons, two other things might happen:

a) there will be future openings at the same company.  That recruiter might be your ticket to an initial interview, or at least pass your resume onto the hiring manager.

b) that recruiter moves onto a new company.  The new company starts hiring.  Boom, you've got an opening there.

The key here is that recruiters are incentivized to source good talent (literally their job), and if you've previously proven to be a solid candidate, then they're happy to move you to the front of the list.

Edit: similar logic also applies to people that you've interviewed for jobs and people who have interviewed you.  An enjoyable, thoughtful conversation and a mutual good impression can be a nice foundation for a new connection.","I also want to add something that seemed to work very well in my attempt to networking. Interviews to me are opportunities to also network and learn more about the problems a team is tasked to solve. It‚Äôs a conversation devoted to see how well your skills are best fit and how great the overall team dynamic is.

With this in mind, after every interview process where I was rejected from the position, I remind myself the interviewers who I had a great interaction with. I would reach out to HR in response to the rejection telling them that I am still interested in future opportunities and would request for permission to connect with the interviewers on LinkedIn so that I can continue to be engaged with their work.

It's always a good idea for scientists who code to learn how to code better. Very often, a small amount of training will go a really long way and is very worthwhile.

However, it's also true in many places that you want the stats guy not the developer. Before you hire data scientists on their programming ability you need to ask yourself what you want from this person.

Still getting recruited.

When I was starting out blogging about statistical analysis and data visualizations I kept receiving comments being a wannabe data scientist and getting death threats because of an immaterial error in a viz (i.e. why I stopped posting OC in /r/dataisbeautiful). When I started applying for data science jobs years ago, I had multiple companies tell me ""your portfolio is incredible, but we can't hire you because you don't have a PhD and it would devalue the PhDs our other Data Scientists have"" or ""we only hire people who have deployed models into production."""

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs good for my health‚Äù","Nope. Here's a pro tip.

Schedule the jobs to overload the server's cluster. Bang out like five of these at once and make sure you assigned high scores to them. At the next stand up move five cards on the kanban board to in progress. Then you have a lot to say about what you did and JIRA shows you to be a superhero!

When confronted by the scrum master just reply: "" I always thought that those who can do, and those who can't become a scrum master. You have changed my mind about the WIP. Thanks.""

Next few stand ups your blockers are that the server is too slow. You don't want to take on any other tasks because the WIP is too large, and making documentation is not agile!!! So you'll be at your desk staring at the screen until the jobs are finished.

Come retro time you have a valid complaint: the server cannot handle realistic data loads, and thus if we're going to compete with other agile firms then we need to embrace agile at scale.

65,2021-05-10,428,Is data science too broad to ever feel prepared for an interview?,"Currently I am not studying for job interviews, I use this as a filter of sorts.  If an interview asks questions that are relevant to my actual jobs and skill, then it is likely I will be a great fit for the job and the work culture.  If they come in blazing with leet code questions and very detailed deep learning questions, then that isn't a place for me.

This is totally due to me being at an alright job at the moment that I could stay at!  If I currently did not have a job I probably wouldn't have this luxury.","Yes, it can be pretty broad.

But to better prepare for an interview, first major thing is to look at the actual job requirements language for clues.

Next best thing you can do though is ask the HR/recruiter contact specific questions about the role, especially during the initial phone screening. This is the main point of that conversation. The phone screening shouldn't be super technical.

It's true that the recruiter/HR person might not know all the nitty gritty answers, but you can still ask certain questions to get a better idea.  'What are the backgrounds of the current team members?' , 'Do you know what tools the team currently uses?' , 'What are the main 3 functions of this job?' etc etc.  If the recruiter doesn't know, then they should probably volunteer to find out.... or you can ask them to find out!","I agree with your general sentiment, though I might add one more type: the stats/experimentation DS. This person would have exceptional stats knowledge, and apply that in pursuit of building organizational metrics, experimentation, A/B testing, etc, with very little time spent building models.

In my current company, the previous data scientist (she left and they hired me) kept boasting that she implemented a facial recognition system to ease the employee attendance system (so instead of tapping your employee card, it will scan your face and you are allowed to enter the building). The ""data science manager"" also boasted a lot about this during my interview and I was really impressed considering that the company has just 1 data scientist and she was able to implement the end to end project by herself. I didn't question much around it as I desperately needed the job. Months later I find out that the FR system was actually implemented by a third party company in China and she was just a project manager. Moreover, the ""data scientist"" and the ""data science manager"" don't know anything about data science and they just had the idea to implement a FR system so they hired a third party to do it. Now they can show off on their website and social media that they are also ""data driven""  and they have ""implemented a FR system"". 

I think a lot of companies are trying to jump on the data science bandwagon without actually considering the business implications of lying and building models that are not validated (aka building it just for namesake).",Come to think of it everything is a wrapper around Matrix operations,"Depends. We have a bunch of consultants that basically dictate everything in my group because my manager is not technical and falls for well dressed bullshit.

If you have 100m data points and 100k stores that means the full sample has 1000 data points per store. If you random sample the full set at 1% that‚Äôs 10 data points per store. Then I assume your model would use a store Id or other identifier to capture the store. Now you‚Äôre predicting based on 10 data points which is problematic.  This assumes uniform sales. If, more likely, stores have a diversity of sales volumes you may well have 0 samples for some stores. 

His approach would fix this, make the sample size much easier to handle on any training set and would result in N models for N stores that are specialized for each store. 

If they wanted a prediction overall, his suggestion doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me.","If the goal is to predict the company‚Äôs total sales, I think your approach is correct.

91,2021-07-28,378,Is it just me or does it sometimes feel like DS only provides marginal value or of no value to a company?,"In my experience, most business questions or problems can be answered or fixed with relatively simple solutions that usually involve joining/merging data from multiple sources, cleaning that data, and filtering/sorting it. There have been very few instances that require very complex models. Actually, it seems that most business decisions can be made with common sense, but having reliable data to back that up isn't always available.

This idea that ML/AI needs to be deployed is usually overkill.","Absolutely.. ML is a buzzword that helps careers. So a lot of DS/MLE roles are just created by VPs looking to oversee an ML org so they can go somewhere where it is of value.

The last place I worked a VP openly told me he was pursuing ideas just in the hopes they would help him get through a FAANG interview. They made no sense at all for our organization and led to layoffs (not him of course).","Data science provides marginal or zero value for most companies, a decent amount of value for some companies, and a ton of value for the very small handful of the rest.  It's high-risk and requires a lot of up-front investment and wholesale process change.  The fact that your client doesn't seem interested in DS actually probably means that they have a clear idea of where they stand on that spectrum and they don't think the upside is worth the cost.

In general, I think consultants pitching DS services to clients very rarely works out.  It's more likely to succeed if the client identifies and scopes the need internally and actively looks to employ FTE or consultants to execute."
92,2021-05-11,369,"How many hours of actual ""work"" do you do everyday?","Protip:  All that stuff you do away from your desk like talking to clients and stakeholders, and briefing management, and such...  that's all ""work"".","How many hours do I work? Nice try, my manager.","Are you hourly or salary? I assume salary because of the nature of the job, but want to clarify in case.

As a salaried person, in my previous role I did about 3 hours per day. I was the only DS on my team at a fortune 500 company, and my boss didn't understand what I did or how I did it, only that it had a big impact on how we make decisions. I automated a lot of my job, and was able to get all of my responsibilities done within 2 - 3 hours. I was still ""online"" in case something came up, but I would do personal projects. (It was a great setup, except because no one really knew what I did, how I did it, or how big of an impact it had, I didn't get any raises which is why I left to work at a different company on a DS team)

All that to say, if you are salaried, you're getting paid to do certain things, not to work for certain hours. A good way to know where your boss is on that is ask if the time you're in the office (or ""online"" if you WFH) can be flexible. If you're boss is okay with flexible hours as long as you get your work done, and maybe at minimum are in the office for meetings between 10-3, that's basically what being salary should mean anyway, you're just adjusting the culture. Just a thought if youre frustrated by the corporate norm--my previous 3 managers have all been okay with a setup like that, but I just had to ask."

Name and shame! Wayfair pulled this with me (it was company ‚Äúblog‚Äù post) not too long ago for a rather senior position. I was only taking the interview to a get survey on comp ranges but it still managed to turn me off even more than I already was. Not a good look to have to send a tutorial to senior leader candidates (who should be domain experts) so they can pass a technical screen.","I went through the Facebook interview process recently. Same sort of situation - they sent me a pretty long list of medium articles describing how to ""crack the Facebook product interview"". The thing that was really got me was the invite to Friday morning interview practice sessions with some current employees and recruiters. I was shocked their interview practice is so broken they actually had time set aside for potential employees to practice for the interview.","I think this is why I'm seeing a greater trend in companies requiring candidates to do take-home assignments now since it's a better indication of how well people will do at their actual jobs. Though this is also a con for interviewees because not everyone will have time to do these kinds of assignments, especially if they get several of them when in-process with several companies at the same time and they still have a full-time job.

Also I doubt companies are just hiring you just based on how well you can answer their specific knowledge-based questions. I have gone through many DS related internship interviews and the question I'm always asked by hiring managers at the final round after passing the knowledge-based questions are my previous DS experiences: what projects I've done, why did I use X algorithm, why did you use these x features, how did you present your insights, what were the impacts of your results/project, etc.

Even the knowledge-based questions can be pretty open-ended. Sometimes I'm given questions like - this metric is going down at the company, how would you investigate this problem? So companies tend to look at how you think rather than look for a specific answer"

Don't try to pretend like you've got it all figured out and just hope to get there before anyone notices.

* Ensure my team is focusing on the customers needs rather than the coolest new SOTA models or tech stack.","Some excellent points so far. To add:  

‚Ä¢ No data, no dice. Make that clear to leadership (SVPs and CXOs).  
  
‚Ä¢ Include domain experts in data curation, labelling, functional validation, testing, and feedback. AI driven automation needs a whole village, not just data scientists.   
  
‚Ä¢ Measure in terms of time, cost, and quality of life (user experience). Not just F1 scores and throughput.  
  
‚Ä¢ Build an ecosystem of Developers, Architects, DataOps, MLOps, DevOps, SecOps, ITOps, and Governance around folks that train ML models.   
  
‚Ä¢ Have a standard set of use cases that you pretrain, **reuse**, and fine-tune models as you go.","Ensure focus on business impact and incremental value delivery. Focus on what the company needs and not on what you (or your team) likes to do. Any model is better than no model, so start with the simplest model possible.

* There's a lot of garbage over the internet.
* Many companies create ""general"" courses just to sell their products, and you end up with a mediocre knowledge of it.
* Courses that teach you a lot of stuff, trend to teach you nothing when you see them from a better perspective.
* ~No~ Most online courses are not completely free, they all have a catch and you should think if it's worth the time.

On a more general subjects:

* Books. They follow a more logical path, and most of the times also cover good exercises. You can build a small learning path ang get books that cover partially those (Never look for a holy grail if you want to really do things right).
* Project and documentation. This is what hangs around longer in your mind and stays as a proof that you certainly understand the topic. Also documentation normally have everything you need (even in poor documentation cases). They usually include some proof of concepts that you can use to understand the basics."
98,2021-05-09,348,So you trained a model. Now what?,"APIs are common but also scheduled batch jobs that perform some ETL to get the data in a format for prediction, then load a trained model object, complete the scoring and upload the data.  

This all can involve lots of technologies: docker, kubernetes, Gitlab CI/CD, etc","You're building a model to try and gain some value or insight. As another poster mentioned, you would use an API or have some batch process, but what do these do?

In a batch workload you are trying to apply your model over an entire known population. You can use this data for lots of different things, like feeding other analytic processes or to update data behind an API (you could bucket your model scores to attach labels for later decision making). This can be useful for interacting with 3rd parties who want to ingest data or just places where you want to look at the decisions before putting them out there.

For an API you're looking at real time decision making, you're taking in some information and returning a decision of some kind. You could bucket that decision as described above, or just let the caller make the decision for themselves. You could use this for anything online that people are interacting with (websites, games) where you might present different things depending on the user. An example might be to track user behaviour on a website to determine who is likely to convert to a sale, train a model on this information, then use that model to throw discounts at people who are less likely to convert as an attempt to increase conversion rate.","My best resource was this course.
 https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/

99,2021-05-19,340,How to explain to Management that Data Cleaning is a really important part of my job,"Unfortunately this is a common occurrance. There are great responses in this thread but I'll give my two cents.

Say you have a project that you could do in two months (8weeks) if left undisturbed. This was mostly my experience in grad school. I would get a chunk of a grant, buy supplies, then report back to my advisor when I had something to talk about.

This won't fly at enterprise companies. The cadence demanded by naive management is often unrealistic if you're doing work that is challenging or innovating (I would assert this by definition. If your project can follow a regular cadence then it probably isn't innovative or risky. Which isn't bad per se, but expectations should be calibrated accordingly).

My advice is slow yourself down in the long run for short term gains that appease management. Rather than cleaning all the data, clean enough to make a simple sklearn logreg on your local comp. Make a graph. Show it to the boss. Then tell them you are iteratively improving it for increased gains. Your two month project will likely blow up to three or four months but there will be much less friction from people who learned about data science from SCRUM manuals and management books.

This hits close to home so sorry if I sound salty. But TLDR: nerf your models intentionally so that you can present ""fake"" results at a pace conducive to what they find acceptable.

EDIT: Typos","I'm  in data science and analytics, with a Ph.D., and I've been in the field for twenty years.  If you ask any data science how much of the work is locating and cleaning data, the stock answer is ""80%"".   I can't tell you how many times I've heard this.",[deleted]

Marketing analytics at a commercial real estate company. I took it because I previously worked in a marketing role there and wanted to transition to analytics but had zero quantitative qualifications so it was the only way I could quickly transition. 

The analytics role was frustrating. I was on a team of ~50 marketers and they would all say over and over how they wanted to make data-driven decisions and use the data to work smarter and they needed this report or that etc etc etc. The reality was they just wanted to be able to check the box that they had looked at the data and say to the CEO that they were data driven. But they rarely used any of my analysis, and most barely understood it no matter how much I tried to distill it for them. (Or they understood ‚Äúincreasing good decreasing bad‚Äù but still didn‚Äôt apply it to their decision making.) I was already job searching but a moment that still stands out to me is when a marketing director said ‚Äúcan you modify this quarterly  report ... but without using any numbers?‚Äù 

On top of that, I was the lone data person on my team, so I had no one to collaborate with or learn from, and also my basic reports were barely used so there was no opportunity to try to upskill and provide anything more advanced. 

TLDR: roles like this can be frustrating because no one actually values your work and there‚Äôs limited opportunity to grow your skills."
